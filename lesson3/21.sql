### CASE Statements Quiz

/* 1. We would like to understand 3 different levels of customers based on 
the amount associated with their purchases. The top branch includes anyone 
with a Lifetime Value (total sales of all orders) greater than 200,000 usd. 
The second branch is between 200,000 and 100,000 usd. The lowest branch is 
anyone under 100,000 usd. Provide a table that includes the level associated 
with each account. You should provide the account name, the total sales of 
all orders for the customer, and the level. Order with the top spending 
customers listed first. */


/* 2. We would now like to perform a similar calculation to the first, 
but we want to obtain the total amount spent by customers only 
in 2016 and 2017. Keep the same levels as in the previous question. 
Order with the top spending customers listed first. */


/* 3. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are 
sales reps associated with more than 200 orders. Create a table with 
the sales rep name, the total number of orders, and a column with top 
or not depending on if they have more than 200 orders. Place the top 
sales people first in your final table. */


/* 4. The previous didn't account for the middle, nor the dollar amount 
associated with the sales. Management decides they want to see these 
characteristics represented as well. We would like to identify top 
performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more 
than 200 orders or more than 750000 in total sales. The middle group 
has any rep with more than 150 orders or 500000 in sales. Create a table 
with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, total sales across 
all orders, and a column with top, middle, or low depending on this 
criteria. Place the top sales people based on dollar amount of sales first 
in your final table. You might see a few upset sales people by this criteria! */
